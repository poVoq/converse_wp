# Notice
This is a work in progress based on the original ConverseJS Wordpress plugin.

See: https://wordpress.org/plugins/conversejs/

# Todo

- [x] Clean up source of "chatme.im" references
- [x] Make compatible with ConverseJS release (5.0.1)
- [ ] Update to ConverseJS 5.0.2
- [ ] Remove build-in ConverseJS release if possible (reference to seperate install instead)
- [ ] Optional choice of using self-hosted ConverseJS or CDN version
- [ ] Include OMEMO 3rd party library
- [ ] Enable new ConverseJS 5.0 settings (like OMEMO by default)
- [ ] Short code for embedding
- [ ] Short code for full screen chat page

# Recommendations

- Best in combination with ejabberd (but Prosody will also be fine)
- Check out the great XMPP ejabberd account tools: https://beherit.pl/en/wordpress/plugins/ejabberd-account-tools/
- This is also cool: https://beherit.pl/en/wordpress/plugins/xmpp-statistics/
- A cool alternative to ConverseJS is Movim: https://github.com/movim/
